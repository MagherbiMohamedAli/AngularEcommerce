## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS (long term support) version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

## Steps to Run the Project Locally   
First, clone the project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or gitBash and run:
**git clone https://github.com/MagherbiMohamedAli/AngularEcommerce.git**
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:
cd into it

Install the required dependencies by running:

**npm install** (npm i)
This will install all the necessary packages as defined in the package.json file (node_modules).


Run the json- server by running: 
**json-server --watch db.json** (Port 3000 by default)

To start the application locally, run:
**ng serve**
This will start the server and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.
